### Summary of Architecture
The first version of the App has five feature modules, which are the account module, the post-question module, the answer module, the searching, and the information feed. 
The account module allows users to create new accounts, log in with accounts, and modify account information (avatar, user name, etc.). The Publish Issues module allows users to publish issues. By adding titles, content, and even cover art, the description of the problem is more complete. The Reply to questions module allows users to write a text comment on a question. The search function allows users to enter the keyword of the title to search for the corresponding question and reply. The feed feature allows users to browse recommended content. Recommended content is presented according to a simple ranking algorithm.
The recommended algorithm rules for information flow are as follows:
1. Prioritize user interest and problem classification
2, then recommend according to the latest addition time in the database
